Digi-Pro term 4 project 1.

Default draw mode
- Type in frame number on the top left in the input field.
- load an image into each view with the image button on the bottom left and right corners.
- once loaded, images can be removed with those same buttons.
- touch and drag / release to draw lines. (Defaults in Draw mode)


Edit Mode
-  hit the edit toggle button on the bottom center to use Edit Mode.
-  In edit mode, touch and drag existing line-points to modify them.
-  In edit mode, the top right "Delete Line" button acts as an eraser.  Turn that toggle on 
   and touch a linepoint to delete that line.

Hit morph button on the Top-Center when ready to morph! 

there is not yet a progress bar...
After morphing is finished the animated frames will play on the left view.  
The corresponding still frames will show on the right view.  
- Use Prev. and Next buttons to step through the morphed frames. 


-  Clear lines button will remove all lines in any mode, and will also reset so you can
morph again!


-  For some reason, sometimes the input field's keyboard doesn't like to go away. 
   If experiencing this issue, I suggest entering the number of frames you want before 
   loading images or doing anything else.  (it's a feature ? )
